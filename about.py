    <p>Forest fires are on the increase worldwide. Forest fires are a threat to our environment because they spread quickly and can burn down acres of lush forest if they are not attended to. Forest fires occur due to various reasons. As climate changes continue and temperatures increase by a few degrees every year, the forest fire will increase also. Trees that took many years to grow disappear in a very short time because of fires, leaving mountain areas barren, no longer providing protection from rains and mudslides following those rains, no longer providing oxygen clean air and shelter and food for birds and animals.
    Usually the forest fires originate very discreetly and rangers are notified about the fire until it’s too late. This is because fire occur in dense forests where humans can’t possibly pose a challenge for the rangers.</p>
    <p>We have made this project to tackle this real-life problem using the state of the art technologies. Using the power of Jina AI, we have created a solution for this problem.</p>
